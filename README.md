# What is it?

Cortado is a fork of [Raymond Hill's uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix) browser extension: a Chromium browser extension to black/white list requests. It integrates with advanced privacy and security services from Apozy. The original project is for advanced users. This is for everyone -- we've taken the overhead of managing fine-grained permissions per site and simplified it using uMatrix as the underlying engine.
